When she's not studying, she loves makeup. She watches YouTube videos of makeup bloggers on her laptop and does her makeup simultaneously. "This person works at Sephora. She's really good and has lots of videos where she makes herself look so different...This is my escape."</p>

                        <p>The day started at 9am trying to find Sanaaa in the crowded courtyard of the University of Technology, Sydney. Sanaaa is in her 3rd year of engineering school, though has no intentions of becoming an engineer. She’s doing the degree to satisfy her parents, and to ‘train her mind for organization’. Instead, she wants to be an internet celebrity for makeup and clothes. She wants to create video tutorials for other muslim women who need to cover a bit more than the average Australian. Her family moved from Pakistan when she was 13, and her life straddles the two cultures with technology. She talks to family throughout the day, watches Turkish soap operas and shops online for makeup as a break from studying. </p>

                        Day two was more studying and applying for summer internships. She’s not sure what type of job to apply for but she’s collecting postings, and making many lists. We went to lunch at her favorite place in the local mall, Nandos, and shopped for winter shoes and lipstick at kmart. “I can buy this cheaper online.” She also went to the grocery store to get the biscuits she likes to bring to her friend’s house later in the evening.

                        The evening before the observations started, we met Luke and three friends at his home. Two friends had been at university with him, though they graduated a few years ago and are struggling with their first-time jobs. The other woman, actually Luke’s aunt, is very close with Luke and they talk nearly every day. Though she isn’t as active on Instagram and Snapchat like his other friends. They made fun of her big iPad, calling it a device for old ladies.</p>

So he studied and tried to buy used textbooks through Gumtree for most of the day, with many many interruptions for Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook. In the afternoon Luke went for a run, “to have something to Snapchat about.”</p>

                        <p>It was Saturday and Luke and his partner, Jay, needed to go shopping for a birthday gift for Jay’s brother. Unfortunately, the gift Jay wanted to buy was something he couldn't track down-- a book about Simpson’s art. It was very interesting to watch the two of them look online and call shop after shop, trying to figure out who might stock the book that day. If only they had planned ahead to buy it on eBay!
